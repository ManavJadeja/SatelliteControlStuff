This is the first readme I made while writing the code (as opposed to after)
Hopefully, it is better than the previous ones and I don't have to rewrite it much
Without further adieu, let's just right into it!

Ok so this is me a few days in the future after writing a couple objects
There is no way in hell I can shove everything onto this one readme
So instead this one will have a general overview of what is present
In each folder, you will find a readme that explains what is in that folder
And maybe some details on how to use it (though its best to look at the code for details)
